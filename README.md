## Main Business Question
How can we understand the difference in usage between guest users and member users? Are there opportunities to convert guests into members?

## Project Goals
- **Usage Patterns:**  
  - Who uses the app more: guests or members?

  - Which regions have the highest usage?

- **Preferences Analysis:**  
  - What types of vehicles are preferred by each user type?
  - What is the preferred payment method (cash vs card)?
  - What are the average distance, duration, and trip cost?

- **Financial Analysis:**  
  - Do guests spend more per trip?
  - Who travels longer distances?
  - Spend and revenue per kilometer.

- **Geo Segmentation:**

  - Are there regions that deserve focused membership campaigns?

- **Performance & Satisfaction (if ratings are available):**  
  - Is there a difference in driver ratings between guests and members?
